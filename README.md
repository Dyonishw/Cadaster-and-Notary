# Cadaster-and-Notary

2 Smart Contracts that can store Real-Estate properties based on their unique cadaster numbers and transfer
those properties between ethereum adresses.

These are by no means production ready smart contracts and are used for development purposes only.

This is a work in progress and I am still debugging the code or even check for critical contract logic.

Tests will be pushed soon.

Honest feedback would be very much appreciated.
